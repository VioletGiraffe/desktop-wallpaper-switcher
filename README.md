desktop-wallpaper-switcher
==========================

Cross-platform (Windows / Mac OS X / Linux) desktop wallpaper switcher and wallpaper list manager; also has a simple image browser for quickly sifting through your heaps of wallpapers (and deleting those you don't like.)

Building and usage: should be straightforward for Windows, as long as you have Qt installed (works with both Qt 4 and Qt 5, x32 and x64). 

There's no implementation for setting the wallpaper for Mac and Linux yet.
