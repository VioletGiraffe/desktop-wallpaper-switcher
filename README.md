Desktop Wallpaper Switcher
==========================

A cross-platform (Windows / Mac OS X / Linux) tool for cycling desktop wallpaper at a regular interval. Has a wallpaper list manager and a simple image browser for quickly sifting through your heaps of wallpapers (and deleting those you don't like.)

#####Building and usage
Should be straightforward for Windows, as long as you have Qt installed (works with both Qt 4 and Qt 5, x32 and x64). 

###Download
Only Windows version is available for now (Win XP, 7,8; 32 and 64 bit compatible).

###Note
There's no implementation for setting the wallpaper on Mac and Linux yet, the rest (UI and cycling logic) should work.
